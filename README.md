# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Justin Finn

I'm a computer science student who genuinely loves solving problems, building things, and understanding how systems work from the ground up. Right now, I'm actively looking for **internships**, **junior/entry-level roles**, or **research opportunities** in areas that challenge me and help me grow.

### ðŸŽ¯ What I'm Interested In

Iâ€™m especially excited about:

- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** â€“ I'm fascinated by how models learn, especially deep neural networks like CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and more.
- **Robotics** â€“ I love the intersection of hardware and intelligent software. Companies like Boston Dynamics inspire meâ€”I'm interested in building systems that move and function, continuously pushing their cognitive abilities.
- **Computer Architecture** â€“ Understanding how software runs at the hardware level helps me write better, more efficient code.
- **Software Engineering** â€“ Writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code is something I take seriously.
- **Cybersecurity** â€“ Iâ€™m minoring in it and learning how systems break (and how to protect them).
- **Spanish** â€“ Also minoring in Spanish because I value communication, culture, and being able to connect with more people.

### ðŸ”§ Projects I'm Working On

- Cleo Project (Designing and building a mobile robot using a Raspberry Pi, LiDAR, and camera sensors to autonomously navigate environments and identify target objects.)
- Artificial Cognitive Research Paper (Conducted experimental analysis on the cognitive modeling potential of various neural architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent networks.)
- Currently working on projects including various neural networks such as graph neural network models, convultional neural network, and more.
- Developing an AI-driven interior design tool that uses LiDAR scanning to generate 3D room maps and applies a Graph Neural Network to arrange furniture based on user preferences and spatial logic.
